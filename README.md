Simple Backup Script
A lightweight batch script for creating backups of essential files and folders-documents, photos, videos, and more. Quick to use, easy to customize.

What It Does
This copies files form:
C:\Users\"user"\document

to your backup drive or folder:
D:\Backup_folder

It includes:
All subfolders (/s)
Hidden files (/h)
Only new or updated files (/d)
Full file paths shown as they copy (/f)

Customize it
To use this script for your own files:
Edit the source path (C:\...) and the destination path (D:\...) to match your step.
Save and double-click again to run your customized backup.

ðŸ“Œ Note: Iâ€™ll be updating this script soon â€” stay tuned!
